    "In this notebook we'll see how to use recurrent networks to create a character-level language model for text generation.  We'll start with a simple fully-connected network and show how it can be used as an \"unrolled\" recurrent layer, then gradually build up from there until we have a model capable of generating semi-reasonable sounding text.  Much of this content is based on Jeremy Howard's [fast.ai lessons](http://course.fast.ai/), specifically lesson 6 from the first course.  However, we'll use Keras instead of PyTorch and build out all of the code from scratch rather than relying on the fast.ai library.\n",

In other words, we need to split up our data (which is one long continuous stream of text) into n chunks of equal-length streams of text, where n is the batch size.

The real fun comes when we make the jump to a more complex unit like the LSTM.  The details of LSTM's are beyond my scope here but there's a great blog post that everyone links to as the canonical explainer for LTMS, which you can find [here](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).  This is the easiest step yet as the only thing we need to do is replace the class name.  The only other change I made is increasing the number of hidden units.  Everything else stays exactly the same."
